/*
A hero is on his way to the castle to complete her mission. However, she's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! Each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets she should carry.. Assuming she's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will she survive?

Return True if yes, False otherwise :)
